**Welcome to PaintVR**

**Version: 1.0.0**

**Hello**

PaintVR is a tool that is quite simple yet also sophisticated in its own way. To the layman or common user it may not seem so, however, there is quite a bit vector programming that helps the user draw realistic lines and shapes in VR with PaintVR

**How to Install**

If you wish to compile from source, simply clone the repositry and open the project folder from Unity. I have used Unity 5.5.3f for this project. 

If you wish to use the executable and find more information about this project, please visit the following link:

**How to Use**

The usage of this application is quite simple.

You are given two controllers.

One is to pick the color, and the other is to draw with.

You can choose your color and then draw a line or shape or anything.

**More**

Because of shortage of time v1.0.0 only contains these features. I would like to later add:

- --Texture picker (allows you to work with different textures)
- --Game Modes
